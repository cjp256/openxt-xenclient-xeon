This development repository contains build metadata necessary to get OpenXT up and 
running on certain Xeon-centric machines -- including support pacakges for graphics and 
onboard networking. This will hopefully be merged into OpenXT once it is stable.

For information about OpenXT see our website @ http://openxt.org
For instructions on how to build OpenXT from source see our GitHub wiki @ https://github.com/OpenXT/openxt/wiki/
